VECTORIZED DATA FORM:
year_norm, imdbRating_norm, action, adventure, animation, biography, comedy, crime, documentary, drama, family, fantasy, film-noir, history, horror, music, musical, mystery, news, romance, sci-fi, sport, thriller, war, western

content based filtering: "uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback"

Similarity measures:

1. Cosine similarity - cosine of the angle between 2 vectors
2. dot product
3. Euclidean distance

Great choice! Content-based filtering can work well when you have user preferences and detailed information about items. Here's a simplified step-by-step guide on how you could implement a content-based movie recommendation system using your two datasets:

### 1. Data Preparation:

#### Movies You Like Dataset:
- This dataset should contain information about movies you've liked or interacted with.
- Include details like movie ID, title, genres, actors, directors, release year, etc.
- Create a user profile based on the features of the movies you liked.

#### IMDb Movies Dataset:
- This dataset should contain comprehensive information about all movies on IMDb.
- Extract relevant features like movie ID, title, genres, actors, directors, release year, etc.
- Create a vector representation for each movie based on these features.

### 2. Feature Extraction:

- Represent each movie in both datasets as a vector. You can use one-hot encoding for categorical features like genres and actors.
- Normalize numerical features such as release year.

### 3. User Profile Creation:

- Create a user profile vector based on the features of the movies you like.
- Combine the feature vectors of the movies you like, possibly with weighted averages based on your preferences.

### 4. Similarity Calculation:

- Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to measure the similarity between the user profile vector and the vectors of all movies in the IMDb dataset.
- Calculate the similarity scores for each movie.

### 5. Recommendation Generation:

- Rank the movies based on their similarity scores.
- Recommend the top N movies with the highest similarity scores that the user hasn't interacted with.

### 6. Integration with Web App:

- Implement the recommendation logic in your backend using your chosen programming language and framework.
- Expose an API endpoint that takes a user's liked movies as input and returns recommended movies.

### 7. Testing and Evaluation:

- Evaluate the system using metrics like precision, recall, or Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Fine-tune your algorithm based on user feedback and evaluation results.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Weighting Features:** You might want to experiment with different weights for features based on their importance in user preferences.

- **Dynamic User Profiles:** Allow users to update their preferences over time to improve the accuracy of recommendations.

- **Scale and Efficiency:** Depending on the size of your IMDb dataset, consider optimizing your recommendation algorithm for efficiency.

Remember that this is a simplified guide, and you might need to adapt these steps based on the specific details and requirements of your project. Also, as you develop your system, it's essential to gather user feedback and continuously refine your recommendation algorithm for better accuracy.
