1,Thunder Road,2016,https://boxd.it/ddue,Very solid.
2,Doodlebug,1997,https://boxd.it/TZC,Interesting.
3,Rhubarb,2020,https://boxd.it/A1SY,Decent
4,The Adventures of Andr√© and Wally B.,1984,https://boxd.it/1P7I,Humble beginnings that paved the way for the amazing studio that we have today: Pixar.
5,Luxo Jr.,1986,https://boxd.it/1P7y,"Liked this one, also gave birth to a Pixar icon"
6,Red's Dream,1987,https://boxd.it/1P7o,My favourite pre-Toy Story Pixar short.
7,Tin Toy,1988,https://boxd.it/1P7e,Alright.
8,Knick Knack,1989,https://boxd.it/1P74,Nice vibe to it and is funny.
9,Geri's Game,1997,https://boxd.it/1P6U,"Amazing Short, my second favourite Pixar short. Fully utilises the medium of film; most specifically the editing and the distorting of time and space. Great Stuff."
10,For the Birds,2000,https://boxd.it/1P6K,Huge step technologically - the feathers look very impressive. Also funny.
11,Mike's New Car,2002,https://boxd.it/1P6A,Was funny but that's kinda it
12,Boundin',2003,https://boxd.it/1QVO,"Great message about being grateful for the things you have rather than moping about the things that you lost. Resonated with me, well-made short."
13,One Man Band,2005,https://boxd.it/1P6g,"Character design was great, the animation and movements of characters have a kinetic whip. Saw an interesting review about how there is a grey area as to who the protagonist or antagonist is. Funny at times because of it's absurdity, but it does so in a controlled manner."
14,Lifted,2006,https://boxd.it/1QW8,"The transition from eerie horror to comedy is spectacular - the following one minute is really smart and funny comedy. The rest of the short gets quite predictable, but still humorous. Doesn't have a <i>message</i> as opposed to the other Pixar shorts, but that's something I like about this one. It knows what it is and what it's trying to be - a simple breath (or laugh) of fresh air."
15,Your Friend the Rat,2007,https://boxd.it/1QVY,"The animation and creativity are <b><i>radiating</i></b> from this. Loved the variations in animation throughout the short. It has a really nice vibe to it, overall a good short."
16,Presto,2008,https://boxd.it/1QYI,The humour doesn't come from the comedic timing - it all comes from the animation itself: and that's an underrated skill that must be appreciated.
17,Partly Cloudy,2009,https://boxd.it/1xzE,"My favourite Pixar Short; really sweet and heartfelt. Liked this a lot.

The stork is given a more difficult and less pleasant job compared to the other storks (the job of delivering newborns can be seen as a metaphor for life) - however, he perseveres, realising that his life could be as good or even better than the other storks if he has the right attitude. This is definitely my favourite Pixar short, followed by <i>Geri's game</i> and <i>Lou</i>."
18,Day & Night,2010,https://boxd.it/11kM,"Concept is cool but it's all about the execution - the short <i><b>explodes</i></b> with creativity, ingenuity and imagination. Each frame <i><b>oozes</i></b> with innovation, resulting in a visually stunning short. Great work from Pixar."
19,La luna,2011,https://boxd.it/2WbO,"Very good. Story about a boy coming-of-age, learning to become his own man rather than follow the paved traditions set out by his father and grandfather. The visuals are pleasing and the lighting from the stars looks great. Liked this one."
20,The Blue Umbrella,2013,https://boxd.it/61Wm,"Wow okay the visuals on this are easily the best out of any Pixar short. I thought the ""realistic"" approach was interesting - there is a handheld shake effect to the shots, there are some (intentionally of course) choppy slow-mo's and there is visible film grain. The realistic approach contrasts against the anthropormorphised umbrellas and street objects. I have to mention the visuals again because they genuinely look photo-real. The iridescent neon lights shimmering against the puddles in the street was breathtaking. Despite the techincal marvels, the story was underwhelming and a bit unsatisfying. Still a good short overall."
21,Lava,2014,https://boxd.it/8S9G,Probably the most disappointing Pixar short - but that's not a bad thing because Pixar have set the bar so high that any short anything less than great is deemed disappointing. The concept of animating a song is cool but I don't think they executed it well. Something was missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Still a decent short.
22,Sanjay's Super Team,2015,https://boxd.it/bA6A,"Sweet story. Pretty good short, liked how it was based (mostly) on a true story, and you could feel the passion and heart coming out from it. Great ending."
23,Piper,2016,https://boxd.it/dZaG,Yeah this is a good one. Nice message about overcoming your comfort zone in a triumphant way and confronting the dangers of the world.
24,Lou,2017,https://boxd.it/fntk,"Really liked this one, third favourite Pixar Short.

A young boy is a bully on the playground, stealing the other children's possessions. He then encounters Lou, who teaches him to give and to love. Really heartwarming and loved the ending."
25,Bao,2018,https://boxd.it/iEl4,"I feel like I should like this more as it is objectively good, with great animation and message. There was a bit of disconnect between myself and the film - maybe it was because it was told mostly in montage? I am obviously not criticising it for being told this way because how else are you supposed to convey a collage of moments across 20 years of a child's life?! My final impression is that it is a pretty good short."
