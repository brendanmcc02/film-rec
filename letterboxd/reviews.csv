2020-06-13,Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),2020,https://boxd.it/1cgfkj,3.5,,"Really enjoyed this. Cathy Yan has a vision and she <i>goes</i> for it. Her tone is consistent throughout the whole film - the colours <i>explode</i> with a playful vibrance. And the action scenes!! The choreography is incredible. It's really evident that the director and the people behind this really had a blast working on it.

Although, I thought the script is a bit messy and the first ~40 minutes of this are spent with setting up plot-lines through constant flashbacks which I wasn't too much of a fan of.

Despite those flaws, the film exudes a slick style from Cathy Yan, and is a total blast.

2020-06-14,Hamlet,1948,https://boxd.it/1cnqF7,4.5,,"Not a faithful adaptation, but a faithful one would have a runtime of 9 hours. The length of the material is always a dilemma for any filmmaker that braces Shakespeare's masterpiece: <i>Hamlet</i>.

Personally, I was fine with the cut material. One of the omissions were the duo of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern; who's function were to reveal the dark side to Hamlet, when he has them ruthlessly killed without remorse. While this is not included in the film, there is still a dark edge shrouded in mystery with Olivier's Hamlet - evident through his brutal stabbing of his uncle and his morbid ruminations (<i>""How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?""</i>).

However, what I personally <i>loved</i> about the film was Olivier's respect for the many themes of Hamlet. When I first read Hamlet, I was fascinated by the Play's themes of <b>Death</b> and <b>Legacy</b>. Luckily enough, one of the main focuses of this adaptation were the themes of Death and Legacy. So in a way, this version was tailored to my taste.

Like the ribbon on an already-perfect gift-box, the final sequence of the film serves as a perfect finale to the tragedy of Elsinore. The shot first wades through the corridors of Elsinore as Hamlet is carried upon the shoulders of four soldiers - a regal and heroic image, this image cements the everlasting legacy that Hamlet will hold among the rooms and halls of Elsinore. The shot then lingers to the pansies that Ophelia left behind - calling back to the theme of legacy and remembrance. We then cut to the prayer room, this being the place where Hamlet succumbed to his procrastination and inaction earlier in the film. This illuminates the change in Hamlet's character, contrasting sharply against his <i>""This is I, Hamlet the Dane!""</i> moment in the graveyard. Following this, the camera pans to his mother's bedroom, calling back to Hamlet's verbal assault at his mother. I would argue that Hamlet's insanity reached an apex, causing him to be overwhelmed and to thus lash out at his mother in this scene. This highlights the contrast between Hamlet's troubled state earlier in the film compared to his great sense of purpose that he displayed when he returned to Elsinore. The camera then smoothly transitions (a <i>very</i> impressive feat for a non-American production in 1948) to darkly-lit image of Hamlet being hoisted to the tower on Elsinore: a highly effective metaphor, conveying the heroic legacy that Hamlet will leave behind. This is a perfect ending for the Dane, as he has always had a harrowing fear towards death - however, the memory and stories that he leaves behind will ensure that he will never be forgotten. So in a way, Hamlet has conquered his ultimate fear of death because he will always be remembered.",,2020-06-13
2020-06-29,Cars,2006,https://boxd.it/1dT5Xn,3.5,,"Originally gave this a 3/5, but upped it to a 3.5. Mainly because I found McQueen's journey to be quite endearing, starting as a self-centered hotshot who's only focus in life is to gawk at golden piston cups, changing to a racing car that actually understands there's more to life than just crossing a finish line.

As well as that, Radiator Springs is <i>amazing</i>. I heard somewhere from some interview that at Pixar they always try to make their stories' settings feel like they've been <i>""lived in""</i>.  This rings true with Radiator Springs. The town has an indescribable <i>humble</i> quality to it - the breathtaking scenery  also contributes to the spellbinding nature of the town. Also loved the music choice of ""Sh-Boom by The Chords"" during the neon-lighting scene!",,2020-06-28
2020-07-01,WALL·E,2008,https://boxd.it/1e5QRP,4,Yes,"First act is perfection - The visual storytelling is unparalleled. Second and third act are still good but not perfect. I found that the second and third acts relied more heavily on entertaining set pieces and ""action"" sequences, still a satisfying conclusion nonetheless.

Pixar always has a strong emphasis on character and this film is no exception. Many don't realise how difficult it is to establish a connection between a human (the audience) and an (usually inanimate) object. This leads me on to one of the film's strongest themes - connection. It has a lot to say regarding the human's gradual disconnect with others and their steady reliance on technology. The theme is executed so well in the context of the story because the robots (particular Wall.e and EVA) show more humanity throughout than narrative compared to the humans.

Overall and amazing story and adventure, the only thing holding this back from 4.5 stars is the film's over-reliance on ""action"" in the second and third acts, but this is still a beautiful film from Pixar and a worthy addition to their towering catalogue.",,2020-06-30
2020-07-02,Toy Story,1995,https://boxd.it/1ebyB7,4.5,Yes,"Beautifully captures the endearing blissfulness of childhood. As a child, the smallest and most meaningless problems in the world are sometimes magnified - In the case of Andy, the loss of his favourite toy results in heartbreak, whereas for his mother (an adult), this simple mishappening proves to be insignificant (""<i>Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him</i>""), but through the eyes of a child: it can mean the end of the world.

Furthermore, I was also fortunate enough to have parents that cloaked me in bliss regarding the problems around me. This is best demonstrated when Andy's mother announces that they are moving, Andy is ecstatic - however, as an audience we can see that moving house can be an exciting experience, but it also comes with a headache of stress and logistics. However, these banal matters are never brought to Andy's attention; Andy's Mom takes this responsibility upon her shoulders without her son noticing a single thing. This kind of bliss between a child and parent figure is depicted seamlessly in the film.

Moreover, The writing of Buzz and Woody are phenomenal. Both characters start in similar places - Woody believes himself to be special, but for the wrong reasons. He has a self-centered view of himself, believing himself to be special because he is Andy's favourite toy. Likewise, Buzz (naively) believes himself to be special because he thinks he is a genuine space ranger. Both characters then embark on a journey of self-discovery. Along this adventure, both characters must accept their true purpose and what makes them special - they are not special for the reasons above, they are special because they are Andy's Toys.

You often hear the phrase ""<i>It made me feel like a kid again</i>"". However, in this case it is most apt. In fact, I didn't just ""<i>feel</i>"" like a kid for the 81-minute runtime. I <b><i>was</i></b> a kid, bewildered and in awe of the moments exuberantly brought to life on-screen.

<b>""<i>To Infinity, and Beyond!</i>""</b>",,2020-07-01
2020-07-06,The Good Dinosaur,2015,https://boxd.it/1eC9IL,3.5,,"Has genuine heart. The 3D Rendering is gorgeous - some stills look photo-real. Some scenes were genuinely <b>terrifying</b>.

A thematically simple story of confronting and overcoming your fear. Thought the pacing was a bit off at the start and overall its a decent film.",,2020-07-05
2020-07-07,Coco,2017,https://boxd.it/1eIyZ5,4.5,,"The visuals are <i>gorgeous</i>. Vibrant colours range from the radiant oranges of leaves to the iridescent blues of The Land of the Dead. Truly a feast for the eyes, and is one of the best-looking animated films.

Unkrich echoes Shakespeare's Hamlet by providing some daunting yet thought-provoking ideas regarding the themes of <b>Legacy</b> and <b>memory</b>. Most notably, the harrowing fact that one day we will be truly forgotten by every living person on Earth: the final death, as the film puts it. It is thus fitting that music plays a large role in the film - because our memories live on through art and stories.

Interestingly, this is the most plot-heavy Pixar film. Many twists and turns occur with the plot, leading one discovery to another. In retrospect, the plot twists seem predictable, but not so much in the moment. Not a criticism, just an observation.

The film also features Pixar's recurring theme of Family, however it's execution is anything but. In many of Disney's films, the parent often goes through the change of having to learn to let their child follow their heart, be themselves, etc. (The Little Mermaid, for example) Although, Pixar challenges this in <i>Coco</i>. Ernesto de la Cruz represents the person that follows this mantra blindly: he follows his dream but at the cost of killing his best friend and having no chance for a family. On the other hand, Miguel represents the correct way to approach this mantra. He wants to follow his dream of being a musician, but realises it will cost him his relationship with his family. It is worth mentioning an overlooked yet vital moment in the film - when Miguel's great great grandmother grants him her blessing to return home to save Héctor, but at the cost of never playing music again. Miguel, without hesitation, says yes. This would've been an extremely ambitious move by the filmmakers but unfortunately they take the easy route out by having the film end where Héctor's memory is saved and the Rivera family can play music. This ending is still wonderful but it would've been really interesting if the filmmakers took the road less traveled.

To surmise, Coco is a film about Legacy - presenting daunting yet important ideas regarding the memory of loved ones after they die. They also subvert the typical theme of Family into something fresh, while providing an emotional journey through the land of the living and the dead. Overall, an amazing film.",,2020-07-06
2020-07-08,Onward,2020,https://boxd.it/1eOUFX,3.5,,"Starts off poorly (first act) but then evolves into an actual emotional story. The highpoint of the film is easily the battle against the dragon - not for the theatrics, but because the action is rooted in character and is then followed up by some heartwarming and emotional moments.

There is one phenomenal scene with Ian (Tom Holland's character) staring at his checklist, thinking that he's wasted his only opportunity to meet his dad - then he realises that Barley, someone he had been afraid to call his older brother his whole life, had been the missing father figure that Ian thought he never had his whole life. It's a scene worthy of the top-tier Pixar films and a perfect example of utilizing the film medium to it's absolute fullest potential. The editor and director (Dan Scanlon) deserve a serious pat on the back for that.

Overall, a pretty good film. Heartwarming at times, funny at others. Has an adventurous whimsy to it which I really liked. There is still light at the end of the tunnel for Pixar.",,2020-07-07
2020-07-09,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018,https://boxd.it/1eV6QZ,4.5,Yes,"Oh my god I loved this. A comic-book brought to life in an explosive collage of vibrant colours. Each frame <b>oozes </b>with saturated colours reminiscent of a comic-book, resulting in absolutely<i> spellbinding</i> visuals.

This film's commitment to style is really what sets it apart. The film is a literal comic-book brought to life - through multiple panels on-screen and onomatopoeic text just to name a few. This results in a film that feels <i>alive</i>.

But it's not just the visuals and style that contribute toward the film's personality. The film is populated with incredible<i> human</i> characters, cementing this is a grounded story. This is a true Spider-Man story through-and-through - what it so strongly handles is the overwhelming toll it takes on any person who has to helm the name of Spider-Man. Miles is thrust into the world with his powers, completely bewildered and <i>far</i> from ready. He undergoes the heart-breaking problems that confront any Spider-Man: the loss of a loved one, and the ones closest to you drifting apart. These events break him apart to a point where even he himself doesn't know who he is or what he wants to be. Among all that, he is overshadowed with the thought that he has no choice but to commit to being Spider-Man. ""<i>With great power comes great responsibility</i>"" resonates strongly in this story as Miles learns he has no back door to exit through. <i>He has to get back up</i>. In a truly breathtaking scene, he takes the leap of faith - learning what it takes and truly becomes a Spider-Man.

The best Spider-Man movie since Raimi's Spider-Man 2, and one of the most visually inventive films I have other had the pleasure to see with my own eyes. An animated gem.",,2020-07-08
2020-07-10,Lawrence of Arabia,1962,https://boxd.it/1f0Vc7,5,Yes,"I have never used this word before to describe a film - it is a word that deserves to be used sparingly, only in the most absolute circumstance. Lawrence of Arabia is a <b><i>Masterpiece</i></b>; A miraculous cinematic achievement composed in an utterly <b><i>gargantuan and epic scale</i></b>.

But what constitutes a masterpiece? In my eyes, a cinematic masterpiece is a film where every aspect culminates in a synonymous crescendo that exceeds the extraordinary; Direction, Writing, Acting, Cinematography, Sound and Music.

<i>Lawrence</i> is Director Sir David Lean's crowning achievement as a director. His sheer commitment, motivation and ambition is nothing short of extraordinary in this film. Take for example the wide shots of the hundreds of extras and camels. While other directors may shy away from these vastly complicated shots and stick to medium- and close-shots, Lean possesses a wild ambition to frame these events in the scale that they deserve. The result? A film that is a <b><i>colossal epic and monumental in scale</i></b>. It is no wonder that the BAFTA award for best director is named after Lean because in this film he proves the <b><i>ultimate ambition</i></b> that every director should strive to have: <b><i>An iron will to achieve your vision no matter the cost.</i></b>

Furthermore, Lean's Magnum Opus is aided by the layered and stimulating script of Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of an intimate character study framed against the gargantuan expanse of the desert. The refined script, along with O'Toole's stellar performance and Lean's sublime direction result in a character that echoes Shakespeare's Hamlet, one of the most fascinating characters in all of cinema: <b><i>T.E Lawrence.</i></b>

Ultimately, this is a story of the <b><i>futile struggle of Man Vs The Supernatural</i></b>. We begin the film by seeing Lawrence die by a motorcycle accident - this will become vital later on in the story. We then begin the chronicle at a British outpost in Cairo; we see that Lawrence is a peculiar yet interesting individual; he quenches a candle flame, seemingly without any pain. When a soldier asks him how he does it: <i>""The trick is not minding that it hurts""</i>. In the first scene, we learn of Lawrence's fascination with exceeding the boundaries of a human.

There is also a great sense that he doesn't quite fit in with the environment - Costume designer Phyllis Dalton accentuates this discomfort by fashioning a uniform that doesn't properly fit Lawrence. He feels somewhat <b><i>trapped, without purpose.</i></b> His superiors remark that he is a knowledgeable and talented individual. To his delight, he will embark on an expedition to investigate Prince Feisal. He is granted an extraordinary mission, which leads Lawrence to believe himself to be extraordinary.

It is important to note that Lawrence leaves the British Outpost (where he was ill-fitted and outlandish) for the Bedouin tribes, where he is still an outcast. This cements the fact that Lawrence is truly an extraordinaire. He is a modern man surrounded by men of culture and tradition; They believe supernatural forces to be in control (<i>""God willing""</i>), whereas Lawrence holds the modern belief that he is in command of himself. (<i>""Nothing is written""</i>)

Moments later, Lawrence convinces Prince Feisal that he could cross the deadly Nefud desert. It is a near-impossible task, but Lawrence possesses a surging confidence, believing that he will do it. As they cross the desert, he learns that a man, Gasim, fell off his camel and was left behind. Lawrence turns right around, claiming ""Nothing is written"". This is a man who believes that there are no supernatural forces that control or direct him: He is in control of his fate.

This is a striking contrast to the beginning of the film. In the film's opening, Lawrence doesn't die in a blaze of glory - he dies in an <b><i>insignificant and undermining</i></b> motorcycle accident. A man who constantly rolled the dice his entire life, rolls a one instead of his usual six and thus dies a death that he had always feared: an ordinary accident that contrasts against his extraordinary life.

Much to the surprise of the other tribesmen, Lawrence returns to the Tribe after saving Gasim and another young boy. He has conquered the supernatural (in this case, the sun and desert environment). He is celebrated as a figure - a hero. Due to his heroics, he is then robed in pearl-white clothing. In that moment he becomes Lawrence of Arabia.

Before their attack on Aqaba, a quick blood feud has occurred between the tribes. The man responsible for this, and to Lawrence's horror, is Gasim. It is difficult to discern what truly happens in the mind of Lawrence in this moment, but my interpretation is as follows: Gasim was saved by Lawrence's belief that he could command his own fate. Lawrence thus believes that Gasim was saved by his doing, not at the hands of fate or any other supernatural force. As a result, Lawrence is horrified to learn that Gasim, by a turn of fate, turned out to be the one who shot at another tribesman. This is the first instance in the story where Lawrence learns that no matter how heroic or monumental his actions may be, they will be futile against the bigger supernatural forces at play.

It is also important to note that Lawrence also struggled to kill Gasim because it goes against his moral code - he upholds a sense of mercy that sharply contrasts against the other traditional tribesmen - furthering the exceptionality of Lawrence as a figure.

Lawrence's mental stability then wavers due to the two events that follow: the miraculous siege on Aqaba results in no gold that was promised by Lawrence, and Daud (one of the boys) dies in quicksand despite Lawrence's attempts to save him. These events all culminate to a realisation that no matter how powerful or extreme his actions; they will prove futile at the hands of the Supernatural. Further, Lawrence's reveals a sadistic edge to him as he confides with the British General: claiming that ""[He]<i> enjoyed</i>"" killing Gasim.

That concludes Part 1, and we then move on to Part 2.

We see Lawrence attacking a train carrying Turkish supplies. The attack is a success, but Lawrence is then shot on the shoulder by a man. With five bullets left in the chamber, Lawrence decides to stand still, egotistically believing that he is in command of his fate and he will not die to this hands of this insignificant man (<i>Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet</i>). At the end of the attack, he clambers to the top of the train, his pure-white robes fluttering in the wind with the sun behind his back. The image is baked in a divine gold as he revels in the applause and delights having his picture taken. His self-image and ego have reached a new high. 

After another train siege goes wrong, Lawrence's godly status is suddenly lost among the tribesmen. As a result, Lawrence believes that he must perform another extraordinary act that will regain him his status. He egotistically believes he could simply walk in and scout the Turkish-occupied Daraa. He is easily caught and heavily flogged. Lawrence is ashamed of himself and enters a state of self-dejection. In the blink of an eye, he has lost his surging sense of grandiosity: <i>""Any man is what I am""</i>.

He then returns to the British Outpost, in full uniform. However, nothing has truly changed - there is still an air of discomfort between him and the place. In a conversation with the general, he claims that he doesn't want to participate in the siege of Damascus. However, in this conversation, General Allenby plays into Lawrence's ego, causing him to learn once again of his exceptionality (""All right, I'm extraordinary!""). Lawrence will then lead the Bedouins to Damascus.

On the way to Damascus, they discover a recent slaughtering of a village. Consumed by vengeance, Lawrence charges to kill the Turks. Much to the surprise of the characters on-screen (and the audience), Lawrence savagely murders the Turks. This strikingly contrasts Lawrence's difficulty in murdering Gasim due to the sense of mercy that he upholds. Lawrence's self-image has rendered him a maddening individual.

The city of Damascus is then captured. Lawrence has exceeded the expectations of everyone and achieved what everyone had previously thought impossible. However, despite the miraculous act, Lawrence himself feels empty. He doesn't revel in the fact that he proved himself as an extraordinaire. His achievement is greatly undermined by the fact that the Arabs gave up control of Damascus to the British. As a result, Lawrence feels that his actions were futile in the grand scheme of things.

The film then ends with Lawrence on his way home as a motorcycle speeds ahead leaving behind a cloud of dust; A part of Lawrence has died in Arabia. The goal which he effortlessly strived for feels wholly empty and the glamour and theatrics of his actions feel futile. The film then ends with Lawrence's troubled face masked behind a dusty windshield, the audience's view and perception of him is muddled. He is an enigmatic individual that he himself probably doesn't understand.

<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> is ultimately the story of an individual who believes himself to be extraordinary. He does extraordinary things and commands his fate. However he is reduced to insanity when his heroic actions prove futile against supernatural forces. In the end, the goal which he strived for, which he thought would be full of glamour and celebrated, proved to be hollow, empty. The film draws the conclusion that <i><b>despite our actions, they can and will be meaningless at the hands of fate and the supernatural.</b></i>

Many hail the film as <i><b>grand in scale and epic in magnitude</b></i>. This is mostly due to Lean's gargantuan ambition but <i>Lawrence</i> would not be the cinematic masterpiece it is today without the enchanting cinematography of Freddie Young. The range of colours are spellbinding - the incandescent oranges of the desert contrast sharply against the azure blues of the sea. Young also possesses an innate sense of framing - the result is the breathtaking desert photography that we see today. If we take into account when this film was made, I would comfortably say that this is the <i><b>best-shot film ever made</b></i>.

Sound is also a vital component of the film. The soundscape is as vast as the range of colours - ranging from dead silence to bombastic gunfire. The sound designers understand that <i><b>if everything is loud, then nothing is loud.</b></i> This understanding allows scenes to have more power and significance. For example, Sharif's now-iconic entrance is coated with an absence of sound, fueling the scene with nail-biting tension. On the other hand, the loud and clashing charge on Aqaba feels <i><b>grand in magnitude</b></i> due to this contrast in soundscape.

Moreover, the unique atmosphere of <i>Lawrence</i> was aided by the incredible sound design. A prime example of this occurs when Lawrence and Farraj (one of the boys) are completely exhausted after their trip to the canal. They have lost hope as they reach a broken house. The scene is mostly coated with no sound, except for the creaking of some fences at the beginning of the sequence. It is such a subtle addition but makes a huge difference as it enhances the characters' sense of desolation and hopelessness. And just when the characters think they've lost all hope, a blaring horn from a ferry boat roars throughout the landscape - A light at the end of the tunnel. This one scene effortlessly showcases the profound effect that sound can have on a particular scene.

Furthermore, the iconic soundscape of <i>Lawrence</i> cannot be mentioned without Maurice Jarre's legendary score. When I hear his theme, it genuinely ripples and flows through my whole body, making me physically swell. His score also has an incredible psychological effect; making the four hours spent in front of the screen feel precious and priceless.

Lean's wildly ambitious direction, Young's spellbinding cinematography and Jarre's bewitching music all contribute to <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> not just being a film, but a truly unique cinematic experience. Every time I think about this film it makes me long to be in a secluded cinema with just the screen in front of me and to be completely awestruck by the masterful workings of every aspect on-screen. In which every aspect and component of the film exceeds the extraordinary, resulting in a <i><b>Total Masterpiece.</b></i>",,2020-07-09
2020-07-11,Toy Story 3,2010,https://boxd.it/1f6Jb9,4,Yes,"Watched this this time last year, unfortunately it didn't live up to my recent memory. One of my main gripes with this this rewatch is that the plot takes the pilot seat for a lot of the film, as the characters just react to the situation around them. A lot of situations could reveal or elevate character but the priority in a lot of scenes were other elements - for example, the escape sequence'e only focus is to be tense.

Other than that, it is a heartbreaking and sentimental film. The themes of moving on with your past must have been so relevant when this film released in 2010, as many kids would have grown up with Andy and the toys. There is also some incredible mature themes of suppressed trauma. The ending is so heartbreaking but bittersweet - just as it was intended to be.",,2020-07-10
2020-07-14,Inside Out,2015,https://boxd.it/1ftuPJ,4.5,Yes,"Amazing.

One thing that bugs me is that Pixar (and Ghibli films as well) movies are not <i><b>""made for kids""</i></b>. They are movies <i><b>made for all ages</i></b>. This is a film that not only teaches kids about the importance of embracing sadness and other emotions into their life, but also teaching teens and adults the same lesson.

The writing, as mentioned above, is <i>very</i> impressive.

In an incredibly emotional and humorous adventure through the mind, the audience and Joy learn the importance of embracing sadness into our life. In <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lego-movie/""><i>The Lego Movie (2014)</i></a>, there was a character called Unikitty - and she was the embodiment of pure positivity and optimism. Joy is a very similar character and the film challenges the notion of <i>""Positive Vibes Only""</i>. She undergoes a vital change as she then realises that life (or even a good life, rather) is not going to be populated with only happy memories. I read somewhere that people who experience severe physical or psychological trauma are able to experience extremely high forms of happiness; so Joy has to learn that if Riley wants to be <i>truly</i> happy, she needs to embrace not just memories and experiences of happiness and sadness, but the other emotions also. The film deals with this message in an incredible delicate yet skilled manner.

Quite a swift topic change but - I have never been depressed in my life, but <b>from my understanding</b>, depression isn't an intense amount of sadness or a lack of happiness. It's a hollow feeling, and you encounter an intense lack of hope and optimism for the future. When Joy and Sadness leave the Headquarters, Riley enters a stage of depression. It was nice to see that the filmmakers had an actually good grasp on that sort of topic - but once again, I have never been actually depressed so this is just an outsider's perspective.

Overall, this is a fantastic film. I found myself laughing a lot, this is one of the funniest Pixar films, but in my opinion has the most deserving laughs: they really nail comedic timing and line delivery etc. Nice to see Pixar evolving in other areas you wouldn't think. Loved the themes and lessons that come with it, and was an extremely engaging and compelling story. Bravo to everyone at Pixar.",,2020-07-13
2020-07-18,Akira,1988,https://boxd.it/1fScXl,3,,"Watched it when I was tired so this was doomed to have a low rating from the second I pressed play.

Since I didn't have my full attention on the film, some would consider it unfair for me to criticize it, but I will anyway. I thought the sound mixing was (in some cases) poor. The animators brought a visceral world of Neo-Tokyo to life but the soundscape doesn't elevate this sense of setting. There were a handful of scenes where there is no ambience whatsoever, just the dialogue. There is one scene near the end in a vast environment, but there is no echo or reverberation of sound. The result is that the world of Neo-Tokyo doesn't expand beyond the limited scope of the frame. Despite my criticisms of the sound, I found the sound editing to be effective in the chase scenes.

As mentioned above, the animation is stellar. I've heard that it was animated on one's (rather than two's or three's), and the painstaking work and effort paid off. The chase scenes <i>explode</i> with a sense of kineticism due to the animators' committments.

I feel bad saying this but I don't have anything to mention regarding the plot or themes because, to put it simply: I was very tired near the end. Overall however, it is a great animating achievement.",,2020-07-17

I liked the themes of longing and this sense of being so close to something tangible yet it feels unknown. I feel that maybe the plot was too dense, and thus drew my attention away from these fascinating themes.

The animation and visuals are absolutely gorgeous: colours ranging from the deepest purples to the most divine golds.

Might appreciate this more on a rewatch in a few years time, but at the moment I'm not sure if I'll ever revisit this.",,2020-07-18
2020-07-21,Kubo and the Two Strings,2016,https://boxd.it/1gcgvb,2.5,,"Hm okay, was quite disappointed with this one.

The first 5 minutes are dazzling, I remember thinking to myself ""Oh wow yeah this is gonna be a good one"", preparing myself for the adventure to come.

Unfortunately that amounted to a great disappointment. I thought that this film was heavily impacted by its ""comedy"". Comedy, is of course subjective, but I believed the comedy to be predictable, lacking wit and just simply un-funny. The film also suffered from bathos (Placing a comedic moment right after a serious or emotional moment) which really made me despise the comedic aspect of the film.

On paper, this is a good story. This story echoes the fascinating themes of the idea of a legend. The stories we tell that keep our soul living forever. I really liked the theme, but it just didn't click with me for the film, I didn't find it's execution to be satisfying.

Despite my negative criticisms, this is a <i>beautifully animated film</i>. I revere the filmmakers for their towering ambition and painstaking effort to bring this story to life with stop-motion. Moreover, this film has genuine heart. It really feels like that the director has a story to tell, and this exudes itself in the film. The film has a soul and isn't corporate rubbish. In all honesty, I feel that this deserves to be rewatched at a later time because it feels like there's<i> something</i> lurking about with this film that I haven't quite latched on to - I still need to shoot that one priceless fish with an arrow, like we see in the film.

To conclude, this is a film with genuine heart but I found it to suffer from various problems outlined above. Wish the best for everyone involved.",,2020-07-20
2020-07-22,Chicken Run,2000,https://boxd.it/1gixOL,4,,"This film is <b><i>flawless</b></i>. It is worth mentioning that flawless =/= masterpiece. What I mean is that this film doesn't have any flaws that hold it back in my opinion.

The comedy is incredibly smart, witty and self-aware. The film is chock-full of iconic lines; one of my favourite examples: <i>""Oh, just a little place I call the land of the free and the home of the brave"" ""Scotland!"" ""No! America.""</i>. In fact, I only laughed out-loud three times through out the whole runtime, every other joke had me chuckling. Many American comedies try to have the audience in rolling laughter but many of the British comedies already understand that great comedy doesn't always result in roaring laughter, but in the chortling of an incredibly layered joke.

The writing (I'm not talking about the comedy here) is surprisingly strong coming from an animated comedy. The revolution-centered plot allows some interesting themes to be presented - What I found most intriguing was the recurring theme of idealism: Ginger is wide-eyed at the idea of <i>""wide open places, and lots of trees... and grass""</i>. She holds this ideal to her heart as she spearheads the oppressed chickens to revolt. This then leads me on to say that while I did just write above that the film was basically flawless, my only real gripe with the film is that I wished that they expanded upon this theme of idealism. It would've been really compelling to see Ginger's naive idealism clash with reality, but I realise that I am asking too much of a film with an 84-minute runtime.

It's also a necessity to discuss the claymation. After having gone on a 50-film marathon of animated films, I've learned to revere and respect the towering ambition and iron commitment of the filmmakers involved in the thoroughly complex world of animation. <i>Chicken Run</i> is certainly no exception. I cannot even begin to fathom the hardwork and mental fortitude that went in to a meticulously-designed project such as this. The animation is fantastic, and I fully owe this to all the filmmakers and animators involved.

<i>Chicken Run</i> is an incredibly witty, layered comedy with surprisingly solid writing. The awe-inspiring claymation is like the cherry on top of a cake - I mean pie! Without gravy!!",,2020-07-21

The visuals are one of the strong points of the films, not the colour but the art style: the style evokes celtic art, which is extremely apt because it illuminates the idea that this is folklore brought to life.

2020-07-24,Batman Begins,2005,https://boxd.it/1guKO9,4.5,Yes,"I feel blessed to witness this Batman adaptation.

What I love about this film in particular are it's depths into the psychology and origins of the Caped Crusader. This is truly an origin story through-and-through. The film's steady first act provides (at least in my opinion) some intellectually stimulating arguments. I'm fully aware that the ideas the film presents aren't anything wildly original but it is certainly refreshing to see this kind of thought-provoking material in a superhero film. The arguements in question are accentuated by the fact that they serve as the internal conflict in our protagonist. What I mean to say is that, the questions the film is posing to the audience are also the same questions that rattle Bruce Wayne. This not only constructs a compelling foundation for a character but heavily elevates the story. The arguments in question relate to the justice system: How far must one individual go to pursue justice and abolish crime? Bruce faces these arguements and has to adopt his own moral code in order to fight injustice as an incorruptible symbol.

Nolan's genius as a screenwriter is illuminated through the writing of the supporting characters that elevate the character of Bruce Wayne; Rachel Dawes and Henri Ducard both represent the opposite extremes of the justice spectrum which Bruce wants to pursue. Rachel is a strong-headed lawyer with compassion and understanding, whereas Ducard has a relentless system of justice, believing compassion to be a weakness. Bruce is faced with these two extremes and must decide where he himself will lie on the spectrum. In the end he decides that he will utilise violence and fear against his enemies, but will still uphold a moral code where the criminals deserve to be put on fair trial.

After having presented the intellectually stimulating material to both Bruce and the audience, Nolan still has an insistence to continually challenge not only the audience but Batman himself. In the final scene, Gordon claims that Batman's fear-driven pursuit for justice will result in escalation - attracting more evil for him to confront. This questions the consequences of Bruce's actions. While he has a good intention, it is murky as to whether or not his vigilantism will truly work in the long-term. This eerily echoes the earlier lesson he learnt in the film, in which he learned that personal vengeance will only beget more evil. Not only does <i>Batman Begins</i> carve a solid caricature of the Batman, it also paves a path for him to discover in the future films, specifically in <i>The Dark Knight</i>.

Fear is the heart of the film; one of Bruce's motivations as Batman is to strike fear into the minds of his criminals and adversaries. A striking contrast which I found to be compelling was that while Batman is a symbol of fear towards his enemies, he is also a symbol of hope towards the civilians of Gotham, an effective metaphor for the duality of the character.

Nolan and Goyer's layered screenplay would not have been the same without Nathan Crowley's phenomenal production design. <i>Begins</i> is arguably the greatest rendition of Gotham ever brought to the screen alongside Burton's vision. Gotham genuinely feels so <b><i>crime-ridden</i></b> and <b><i>hopeless</i></b> due to the exceptional work of Crowley.

Despite the film's miraculous achievements, there are some dips in quality. While I did praise Nolan's script above, some lines did feel a bit lumpy or unrefined at times (I thought the quick, expositional microwave-water-vapour talk to be uncomfortable and unnatural). I also found the film to be over-edited at times. Lee Smith shouldn't be discredited for this, but rather Nolan for his shooting style. Many times throughout the film three or four shots were used instead of just simply using one. The average shoot length must've been about 2 or 3 seconds. This overly-quick editing resulted in some scenes playing out with a pace that felt just slightly out of tune.

This is film must've been a dream come true for any Batman fan in 2005 - It's not just a film with theatrics, meticulous set-pieces and tense build-ups of action, but also a riveting examination into the psyche of Batman. A phenomenal adaptation and an unwavering vision of one Christopher Nolan.",,2020-07-23
2020-07-25,The Dark Knight,2008,https://boxd.it/1gBiCX,5,Yes,"If it wasn't for this film, it is very likely that I wouldn't have a Letterboxd account. It is also very likely that I wouldn't have a poster for this film in my bedroom. <i>The Dark Knight</i> was the film that exposed me to the world of film-making, and it is very possible that I would be off playing Counter-Strike or something right now if I had never watched this at the right time.

This film absolutely blew my fourteen-year-old mind away when I had first seen it - I had never been so stunned, enthralled and captivated during a film before. I remember, after having finished the film for the first time, searching up <i>The Dark Knight</i> on YouTube. I vividly recall one video analysing the scene where Batman has the Joker on his grappling hook. The video explained that Nolan has the camera rotate as the Joker delivers his monologue, symbolising the twisted manipulation of the Joker. This stunned my adolescent mind, and I remember thinking: ""You can do that with a camera?!!"". One very simple observation in a seemingly insignificant YouTube video led me to expose myself to more and more films, video essays, articles and reviews. <i>The Dark Knight</i> was the film that made me love films.

This was the first film that I ever gave 5 full stars, and this film sat comfortably at my Number one favourite film for forever. Today, after having not seen this film for about 18 months, I was blessed to watch this in IMAX. And yes, my mind was still blown.

Nolan's (and Goyer and Jonathon Nolan) have a crafted a script which I believe to be intellectually-stimulating and utterly captivating. One of the film's many themes which genuinely fascinated me was its examination about <b>morality</b>.

The morality of Batman's actions and Batman's purpose as a symbol are fully explored in this film. One of the most overlooked lines of <i>Batman Begins</i> is when Gordon claims that Bruce's decision to pursue justice as Batman will result in <b>escalation</b> - he will only attract more evil. The implications of Gordon's line are fully delivered in this film as Bruce's vigilantism attracts his most daring villain: the Joker.

As a result, Nolan questions the purpose of Batman in Gotham.<i> Does Bruce need to be Batman in order to purge Gotham of injustice? </i>This same question rattles Bruce as he sees Harvey Dent, ridding the streets of crime, <b>not as a symbol but as a man</b>. Nothing more. Bruce also reflects upon Gordon's aforementioned claims about escalation. If he never became Batman, would the Joker have come along and terrorised Gotham? These arguments poise Bruce throughout the film, creating powerful internal conflict.

This complicated and winding story thread is then neatly resolved as Bruce learns that Batman does not need to be a hero or an inspiration for good in Gotham - he needs to be whatever Gotham needs him to be. And right now, Bruce needs to protect Gotham from the ugly truth that their city's White Knight has in fact been truly corrupted. Batman has a purpose in Gotham. It's a difficult choice to make, but as Alfred puts it: ""It's the right choice"".

I found that <i>Batman Begins</i> glorified Batman's violence and overlooked the grayness of his actions, and also painted his intention to<i> ""strike fear""</i> as something benificial in the long-term as it meant he could get the criminals off the streets. I was then very glad to see Nolan challenge the implications of Bruce's actions as Batman in this film. In <i>The Dark Knight</i>, <b>Batman's actions are engulfed in totally murky waters</b>. He breaches the privacy of millions, and sits by and allows numerous policemen to die.

<i>But he did those things in the name of justice</i>. By breaching the privacy of millions of civilians, he could locate and eventually overcome the Joker, potentially saving millions of lives from a psychotic terrorists. By waiting out and letting policemen die, Bruce proved that he won't impulsively submit to a terrorist, demonstrating the fact that the Batman symbol was truly incorruptible.

The conclusion Nolan draws is ultimately the heart of the film and also serves as a fitting resolution to the theme of morality. <b>It's not about the outcome or the intention, it's about the consequences.</b> Sure, Bruce was able to locate and overcome the Joker by using the wildly illegal sonar technology, and he did it with good intentions - to catch a psychotic terrorist and potentially saving millions of lives. But at what cost? He breached the privacy of millions and betrayed the hard-earned trust of the entire population. Nolan understands this idea and conveys this through his story - <b>If Batman fights injustice with hints of injustice, is he truly purging crime?</b>

Moreover, the film emphasises the importance of purity in the face of goodness. It criticises Batman's morally-grey actions as outlined above. In an overlooked yet crucial scene in the first act, Gordon accepts that his police department has some men with history of corruption, to which he replies <i>""I'm just working with what I've got""</i>. Gordon is far from his idyllic self as he accepts that his ideals won't always be met, and that he will have to pursue justice with a team full of injustice; it is certainly a grey area. Furthermore, Dent descends from the revered white Knight, to a wholly corrupted individual. Gordon and Batman attempt to cover up his evil actions by placing the responsibility on Batman, however as we have learned with the other lessons in the film (and as we will learn in <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>), this covering-up will eventually prove to be futile. Through this, Nolan emphasises the wildly difficult yet vital task of<i> maintaining purity in the face of injustice</i>.

One of the final ideas regarding Nolan's hefty theme of morality are the hints of goodness in every individual. Nolan has a tendency to dedicate about 10-15 seconds towards insignificant characters in his filmography. Typically it's used for humour, for example <a href=""https://youtu.be/FPaTv98wUsE?t=41"">this man picking his teeth during the underground scene.</a> However, in <i>The Dark Knight</i> this decision to dedicate precious seconds to insignificant and ordinary characters contribute to one of the greater ideologies of the film. The Joker believes that every human is ultimately rotten to their core: he proved that Harvey Dent, the white knight of Gotham, could turn to a murdering psychopath. On the other hand, Bruce Wayne believes that there is good in people. This is why the Ferry Scene carries so much weight - it is a conflict of the ideologies of the protagonist and the antagonist. I think that what Nolan is trying to say is you don't have to be as big and as theatrical as a Batman to inspire good in others. You can be a complete nobody, an insignificant brick in the wall but you can still have a massive impact on the world. It is certainly a hopeful message in a film that projects a hopeless sea of menace and dread.

One cannot discuss or write about <i>The Dark Knight </i>without mentioning the indelible and culturally-impacting performance of Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. Ledger disappears into the role, and I genuinely forget that there is an actor behind that crazed facade. But it is not just Ledger's performance that contribute to the unforgettable portrayal of the character, but also the multi-faceted script of Nolan and co. <i>The Joker</i> is the ultimate antagonist to this rendition of the Caped Crusader. He turns Batman's greatest strength (not killing his criminals) into his greatest weakness. In <i>Batman Begins</i>, it is said that a criminals mind is not complicated. In the case of the Joker, it is neither complex nor simple. This is something Bruce cannot fathom; the Joker has no motivation, he just wants ""to watch the world burn"". Moreover, both Bruce and the Joker compete for the same goal - the soul of Gotham. Bruce wants to prove that there is good in the city, whereas the Joker wants to prove that there is an animalistic hatred and self-centredness in every citizen. Further, the Joker puts severe pressure on Batman, causing him to make truly difficult decisions. One key example of this comes right after the indelible interrogation scene, Batman impulsively decides to go for Rachel instead of Dent. This one line carries massive weight as it revealed the limits to Batman: Rachel is one thing he can't sacrifice for the greater good of Gotham. To briefly surmise, the Joker is a powerful antagonist because he attacks Batman's weaknesses, he is also a villain that cannot be understood and both characters compete for the same goal. It also helps that Ledger gave a decade-best performance to propel the character as truly unforgettable.

One of my negatives about <i>Batman Begins</i> were it's unmotivated and frantic editing. To quote myself directly: <i>""Many times throughout the film, three or four shots were used instead of just simply using one.""</i>. My prayers have been truly answered as Nolan confronts this weakness in his previous film. Each and every single cut has motivation. Batman Begins also cut many times to reveal information, but in <i>The Dark Knight</i>, Nolan learned that he could move the camera to reveal information rather than cutting. The result is a completely coherent sequence that surges with motivation and propulsion, but doesn't feel overly-frantic or awkwardly paced.

It isn't just Nolan's intricate and thought-provoking screenplay that compelled and spellbound me. The film presses down hard on the accelerator right from the first frame and never lets go; it is a non-stop collection of nail-biting build-ups, awe-inspiring sequences and a non-stop ramping and culminating of utterly ratcheting tension. This has to be one of the best-edited films I have ever seen, and serious credit is due for Lee Smith. The way in which multiple scenes are stacked on top of eachother contribute to one of the most tense cinematic experiences I have ever had. Nolan's stellar direction and Lee's driven editing were two vital pieces that contributed towards the nail-biting sequences, but one crucial piece of the puzzle is missing: the score.

The score provided by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is simply <i>immaculate</i>. The booming score seeps over the whole frame, elevating the grand and epic moments such as Bruce's capture of Lau in Hong Kong, and accentuating the shivering unease that comes with the Joker's now-iconic theme. The score grants the film a truly epic sense of scale and grandeur that very few have achieved.

This film would not be the same without it's incredible sound-design. Of course I am a bit biased since I've just walked out of an IMAX screening, but the fact still remains. Each punch feels like it could break every bone in your body and each gunshot kills a part of your soul. Truly stellar sound design.

This film holds an infamous status among film circles: when anyone claims that their favourite film is <i>The Dark Knight</i>, it is assumed that they have surface-level film knowledge and are probably a film-bro. If we're being honest here, that is true about a lot of people who have <i>The Dark Knight</i> among their favourites. Now, with that out of the way, you can imagine how I feel when I tell people that this is one my all-time favourites. Inside I want to scream: ""But I like Lawrence of Arabia too!! I have taste!!"". I used to be ashamed to have this among my top four faves, wanting to substitute it for something respectable like <i>The Tree Of Life</i>, but deep down, I truly loved and revered this film. Today, I finally watched it after 18 months and... I was still completely awestruck. This is not a masterpiece as many claim it to be (it does have some minor flaws which really don't hurt my viewing of the film), but it is an objectively good film, and is exceptional in my eyes. It's honestly a miracle that Nolan was able to make this film. It is incredibly <b>enduring</b>, <b>revolutionary</b> and <b>truly unique</b>. Thank you for getting me into filmmaking.",,2020-07-24
2020-07-27,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,2009,https://boxd.it/1gNHGp,3.5,Yes,"Saw this in a cinema. Good adaptation that focuses on the most important elements - character. Really liked the awkward teen romance, really fits the setting. Teens will always be romantic and hormonal even when the world around them is awaiting dread.

At the start of the film it is very clear that there is a storm brewing. The sun never makes an appearance and the clouds are ever-present. Even at night, it isn't jet-black and the clouds hold an ominous greyness to them. I really liked how the film opened with the Death Eaters terrorising the Muggle world, it made the danger so much more threatening and real. The cinematography, one of the stronger aspects of the film, is very subdued yet beautifully photographed, contrasting very heavily to the days of lively colours in the first two films.

One thing I absolutely revere about <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> is that it's so <b>controlled</b>. The film is not epic or grand in scale. Consider the previous two films: The epic Tri-Wizard tournament in <i>The Goblet of Fire </i>and the heart-racing Ministry sequence in <i>The Order of the Phoenix</i>. <i>The</i> focus in this film is not on the tense wand-duels or the exhilarating sequences. The focus is on the characters and the drama. You can count on one hand the amount of ""action"" scenes there are in the film. This film cares about the characters and the drama - which I thoroughly enjoyed. The rom-com aspect of the film was executed almost flawlessly in my opinion; a perfect balance of awkwardness and comedy. Just how the teenagers do it.

Framed against the teenage romance is the storm that lays ahead. This is why the <b>controlled</b> and <b>intimate</b> approach to the film work so well. The film itself is an embodiment of <i>the calm before the storm, </i>and is a microcosm of the epic adventure that awaits. Director David Yates thoroughly understands this and doesn't make the film bigger than what it is.

The film is not without its faults however. The first act is almost perfectly paced, never dragging and keeping the audience hooked. The film then starts to drag and I found myself losing focus until the scene in the cave as the film approached it's closing.

Another fault I found was with some of the acting. Adolescent and child actors are always a mixed bag, but there are some great performances. Watson delivers a superb performance and Grint plays Ron very well. Lavender Brown was also well-cast. Radcliffe's acting was passable, but I'm aware that he suffered to alcoholism during the filming. Bonnie Wright as Ginny is the real culprit here. There is no chemistry whatsoever between Radcliffe and Wright, leading to Harry and Ginny's romance to be (unintentionally) awkward and devoid of emotion. The blame however should not just be placed on the actors, I found the script to be very lacking during their characters' encounters.

Despite this, this is a well-made film and a welcome addition to the Harry Potter catalogue. The filmmaking and camera-work are impressive at times. As a whole, this is a strong film to act as the predecessor to the fantastic<i> Deathly Hallows </i>duology.",,2020-07-26
2020-07-28,The Dark Knight Rises,2012,https://boxd.it/1gStvH,4.5,Yes,"It's been 18 months since I've last watched this trilogy. I used to have this one firmly ranked above <i>Batman Begins</i> and below <i>The Dark Knight</i>. And now, after having re-watched and re-examined Nolan's trilogy, I now declare this to be the trilogy's most flawed film.

But just because it's the most flawed doesn't mean it's poor per se. I absolutely adore this film, and I think one of the reasons why is because <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> doesn't feel like a standalone film independent from the rest of the trilogy; the <b>film itself is a microcosm of the trilogy as a whole</b>, serving as the conclusion to an epic saga.

One of the many reasons why Nolan's trilogy was so <b>enduring</b> and <b>revolutionary</b> was because it presented intellectually-stimulating themes and ideas in a comic-book movie. I'm well aware that his ideas were executed elsewhere in other films, but it was so refreshing to see this kind of material in a comic-book movie. This film is no exception, Nolan presents some new ideas, while also calling back to many of his other themes throughout the trilogy, especially from <i>Batman Begins</i>. These themes are brought full-circle, and thus allow the film to conclude the epic trilogy in a satisfying manner.

But <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> doesn't only call back to previous ideas seen throughout the trilogy; there are also some new themes presented in this installment. <b>Spirituality</b> is the primary theme in <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>. Nolan understands and conveys the fact that <b>feelings or truths can not be truly buried, concealed or forgotten</b>.

And that is how we find Bruce at the beginning of <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>. Bruce's spirit is broken and shattered, overwhelmed with guilt, pain and despair. For eight years he has reclused in his manor, letting those emotions kill his soul. <b>Bruce seems to have left Batman, but Batman has never left Bruce</b>. The dual-life that he led has taken an irreparable damage on his soul.

The city of Gotham has also been concealed a terrible truth. The city has been built on a lie: they were told that the Batman killed Dent and committed other murders in order to preserve the image of Dent and what he stood for, <b>but an ugly truth will always find it's way to creep into the limelight</b>.

Alfred, who has been trying to mend Bruce's wounds for the past eight years, wants for Bruce to live a life as Bruce Wayne, and to leave the Batman persona completely behind. As a father figure to Bruce, he holds a great fear that Bruce will try to resurrect the Batman, and in turn, to selflessly give his life away in order to combat Bane. In an absolutely heart-wrenching scene with the two actors at their peak, Alfred sees no other choice than to leave Bruce. His absence leaves both Bruce and the audience with an emotionally hollow feeling.

Bruce, with Alfred gone and seemingly no other path to take, retreats under the cowl once again. <b>His wounds and scars aren't confronted, but deepened</b>.

Bruce then confronts Bane in the sewers. The scene is coated with minimalist yet effective sound design, and features no music whatsoever. <b>The result is an indelible scene that feels hollow, empty and un-heroic</b>. Batman is completely outmatched in physicality, but primarily his spirit.

He then finds himself in The Pit - stripped of his bat-suit and his body in total ruin. This is thematically the most crucial part of the story, as it is structured to confront all of Bruce's weaknesses and trauma.

Bane has him taunted as a TV shows Gotham in chaos as Bruce's physical health is repaired. As he is nursed, Bruce's first attempt to escape the pit is out of <b>desperation</b> - he holds a petrifying fear of dying in the pit as his city dies. He fails the jump, leading him to train physically as he believes his body is what keeps him down in the pit. His second attempt to escape is suffused with anger and arrogance. He fails. Dejected at the thought that he will have to helplessly watch his city perish, one of the prisoners instructs Bruce to confront and accept his fear; the fear of dying as a failure in the pit. He then makes the climb without the rope, fully immersing himself in his fear, bringing the theme of fear full-circle as it was introduced in the first film.

Bruce then returns to Gotham, his wounds healed and tended to. He experiences a resurgence of purpose as he dawns the Bat-suit, <b>not to hide, but to defeat Bane as Gotham's heroic symbol</b>.

Bane is defeated and Batman saves Gotham. The ending of the story is the absolute perfect ending to Bruce's arc - Batman has been concreted as an everlasting symbol, and Bruce has left Gotham and Batman behind to pursue a life as Bruce Wayne, not as anyone else.

 And that is my brief analysis of Bruce's thematic journey throughout the <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>. I thoroughly enjoyed the new Catwoman and Detective Blake in the film, however I found myself disappointed at Bane. His most important function is to banish Bruce to the pit, but other than that his motivations are a bit muddled in my view. Despite that, Hardy delivers a brutally menacing performance.

There are also some phenomenally-crafted scenes in this film, scenes that are so good that they can be endlessly watched on YouTube. My favourites were Batman's first reveal, Alfred's goodbye, Batman's first encounter with Bane, Bruce's escape from the pit, and the reveal that Bruce is alive and well in Florence, away from Gotham. Each scene is a staggering combination of the mastery of directing, editing, acting, sound design and music, coalescing to form some truly magnificent scenes.

The film is not without it's faults - it isn't flawlessly paced and arranged like it's predecessor <i>The Dark Knight</i>. I felt that the conclusion could've been more satisfying had the tense build-up been executed better. There are also a few cases of Nolan's lumpy expositional writing  that feel awkward and hurt the ""realism"" aspect that Nolan so desperately tries to achieve(<a href=""https://youtu.be/ZKIYkdE3S0Y?t=65"">""The clean slate? Where you type in someone's name, date-of-birth, and in a few minutes they're gone.""</a>).

And that concludes my review and analysis of <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>, however, as I wrote above, this film is a microcosm of the trilogy as a whole, so I feel that it would be apt to write my thoughts of the trilogy itself.

I absolutely love this trilogy. It's easily my favourite of all-time, and it is such a joy and privilege to be able to advance through the trilogy, from beginning to end, and to genuinely feel that you've <b>experienced something</b>. You felt the character's pain, suffered their losses. You also felt the magnitude of the epic moments and the awe of the spectacle.

I still can't comprehend that we actually could experience a trilogy like this. You ever hear people have far-fetched wishes that would be so cool but would never happen? <i>""Imagine if Christopher Nolan directed a thought-provoking and flawlessly-crafted James Bond! I wish The Hobbit was re-made as one 4-Hour film!""</i>. The Dark Knight trilogy feels too idyllic, too good to be true. Nolan's re-imagining of The Caped Crusader is everything I have ever wanted in a superhero film and it is a total miracle that this trilogy was made.

The trilogy was <b>revolutionary</b>, <b>enduring</b> and <b>wildly original</b>. It changed the face of comic book films, showing that a film with a superhero could be just as, or even more interesting than a film without one. This genre of films garnered a massive amount of respect due to Nolan's impeccable work. These films left an indelible mark on the film industry and it is certain that these films will never be forgotten, a symbol just like the one Batman left behind for Gotham. To Christopher Nolan, Thank You.",,2020-07-25
2020-07-28,It's Such a Beautiful Day,2012,https://boxd.it/1gVvvv,4,,"Very impressive. There are so many techniques and tricks going on with the camera and the filmmaking itself. The film is so good at making you <b>feel</b> something. At first, it emits a real feeling of pessimism - <i>""You will only get older""</i>, but ironically the great sense of pessimism in the film makes you appreciate those small nuances of beauty that you always overlook and never take for granted. This is a gorgeously melancholic film.

This is off-topic, but this film marks the end of my animation marathon. It all started with Studio Ghibli in February, then on to Disney in April, advancing to Pixar in June and then arriving at some miscellaneous ones - Akira, Your Name, Chicken Run, Song of the Sea. Was an absolute pleasure to experience all of these painstaking pieces of wonder.",,2020-07-27
2020-08-03,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,1990,https://boxd.it/1hvdvp,3.5,,"This was a film that I used to love as a kid - my hazy and fractured memory was that of a film that was playful, whimsical and fun.

To my surprise and relief, the film held up to my memory. The film's playfulness and whimsical nature is infectious - it places you in a state of ease where you just let the comical antics just wash over you.

And that is the film's greatest strength: it doesn't take itself too seriously. The action scenes are exciting (they are surprisingly well-choreographed) but also allow for absurd comedic moments; for example, the fighting in April's apartment is laced with Leonardo paying a visit to some fish in a water tank, and his head is later used to play the piano. I was very impressed to see Barron maintain his playful tone in laser focus throughout the entire film.

The editing in this is genuinely really solid. Nostalgia is not saying that for me, that is genuinely true. It really isn't a surprise then that one of the editors turned out to be Tarantino's editor (Sally Menke) until her unfortunate death in 2010. There's an impressive smash cut where April says ""Where's Raphael?"" and then it abruptly cuts to Raphael getting pummeled by the Foot clan ninjas. Overall, the film has a consistent and coherent pace, and I would largely credit this to Sally Menke.

Nostalgia is very powerful yet also quite dangerous. The personal nostalgia I had for this film was very strong at times, but it wasn't strong enough to coat some of the film's flaws; but it made me reconsider - the film clearly doesn't take itself too seriously. The film's purpose is to provide the audience with a fun and whimsical 90 minutes. It achieves that, but the result of this is that it makes the flaws seem so insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Who cares if the expositional-backstory scenes are useless? At the end of the day, the film still achieves this goal. Now I know that this is something that is extremely unhealthy for film criticism; I'm essentially saying that this film is exempt from flaws. That is what I am implying but I don't think that it's true. No matter the objective of a film, or how personal or emotional it is, every film should be available to be put under scrutiny for it's flaws - if it has any (in 99.99% of cases, a film does have at least one flaw).

So, my conclusion for the above paragraph is: Yes, the film is fun and playful and the flaws (yes this film has flaws) don't impact or hurt this tone; but these flaws hold the film back from not just being a fun movie, but a great one also.

Now, to the flaws! I mentioned the expositional-backstory-flashback scene above. Splinter, for no apparent reason, starts to monologue about the origins of the turtles and himself. The audience really doesn't need to know that the turtles grew because of radioactives. I also think that the revealing of this information completely ridded the ambiguity that surrounded the turtles. If no explanation was given as to why there are human-sized turtles in New York, it would have added to the absurd yet whimsical nature of the film. I found the acting of the character Danny to be quite atrocious. I also thought that the film's conclusion should have been rewritten. The turtles fight the Shredder one-by-one, not realising the effectiveness of teamwork. The suitable ending then would obviously be the turtles teaming up to defeat the Shredder; but instead Splinter returns to defeat the Shredder, rendering the turtles with no definitive arc.

I still love the film for it's playful tone. Great work Barron.",,2020-08-02
2020-08-03,Ryan's Daughter,1970,https://boxd.it/1hy2wR,4,,"A great David Lean film is often synonymous with four things: an ethereal and swooning score from the magnificent Maurice Jarre, luscious cinematography from the fantastic Freddie Young, stellar performances from an excellent ensemble cast and the epic scale of an ambitious David Lean.

<b><i>Ryan's Daughter</i> has all of those elements, but the result is not as monumental as Lean's other works of mastery</b>: <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, <i>Bridge on the River Kwai</i> and <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. The film is still good, mind you, but I found it to have some flaws that I've yet to see in Lean's other work.

<b>What I love about Lean's work is his sense of scale and grandeur</b>. His films emit this epic sense of grandiosity that only comes from the Golden Age of Hollywood. <b>It makes viewing his films an experience</b>, which is something I absolutely revere about Lean's films. It was difficult for me to admit, but I don't think the grand scale worked with this film. I found that the film should have been a ~120-minute intimate character study focusing on Rosy. While we do get this in the final film, we also get to see the conflict between the Republican Irish and the British soldiers. Personally, I thought this entire subplot should have been omitted in the final film; we didn't need to see a scene in which the villagers salvage supplies off a stormy beach. The subplot doesn't relate to or impact Rosy directly, and thus should be cut from the film.<b> Had this been left out, it would've resulted in a film with a tighter focus and a sharper, more purposeful runtime.</b>

I also found the character of the mute Michael to be useless. Every time he was on-screen, I couldn't help but feel that his presence didn't serve any true purpose. Had his character been cut, it would've resulted in the aforementioned <b>clearer focus and sharper runtime</b>.

David Lean's films are masterclasses in editing - the most iconic cuts in cinematic history lie in his films after all; but the editing in Ryan's daughter proved to be awkward at times. The obvious example is the scene in which Rosy and Doryan kiss passionately in the forest. The scene is interlaced with seemingly random cuts to nature; for example: a spider-web. I admire the concept, but its execution is awkward and clunky. Other than some curious editing choices, the film is mostly well-edited.

While the film does have its flaws, there is a genuinely good and solid film to be found if one looks close enough. What captivated me most about the film were its themes of <b>desire</b> and <b>longing</b>.

<b>There are many recurring motifs that support this theme</b>: Footprints play an important role in the film; an effective symbol representing the <b>sense of searching or longing for something</b>. Furthermore, there is a repetitive asking of one such question in the film: <i>""What do you want?""</i>. In Lean's masterpiece <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, the film tackled the idea of identity, and thus the eponymous character was asked various times throughout the film: <i>""Who are you?""</i>. The same is done in <i>Ryan's Daughter</i>, except that the question does not relate to identity, <b>but to the longings and desires of the character</b>.

Rosy starts the film as a young lady <b>longing for more in life</b>; wanting to break free from the banalities of the village life. She seeks a relationship with the school teacher, Charles. They end up marrying, <b>but one can easily see that Rosy's infatuation with Charles is not fueled by her love, but rather her sense of longing and youthful desire</b>. On their wedding night, Rosy wishes to embrace physically with Charles but he turns her down. At this particular moment, the relationship dwindles and <b>Rosy realises that the relationship she so badly wanted didn't turn out to be as expected</b>.

 There is an absence of warmth to their relationship and it is clear that they don't truly love each other. As a result, Rosy flees to the beach in tears, and she then is consoled by Father Collins. What the follows is perhaps the most vital quote of the film: <i>""Don't nurse your dreams[wishes], Rosy. You can't help having them, but don't nurse them. Because if you nurse your dreams[wishes], they tend to come true.""</i>.

A British soldier, Doryan, is then stationed in the town. <b>He is everything that Rosy longed for in Charles</b> - a handsome, young man who has a desire for <i>""the pleasure of the flesh""</i>, as the film puts it. Rosy kisses passionately with the man, and thus commits adultery. She is then ridden with guilt at being unfaithful to her husband, but is also stimulated by the physical sensation that Doryan provides, as opposed to her husband Charles.

Later, Rosy realises that her relationship with Doryan is emotionally hollow, and they only have a desire for each other's bodies. In addition to this, Charles discovers that Rosy has been unfaithful to her. And to top it off, the town is extremely disdainful of Rosy when they discover that she has not only been committing adultery, but with a British soldier. What then follows is a traumatic scene in which Rosy is swarmed by the village and has her hair cut off. Earlier, Doryan commits suicide by explosives. In short, the act of adultery with Doryan resulted in severe consequences for Rosy.

The film then ends with Rosy and Charles moving away to Dublin. Their relationship is hanging by a thread and it is expected that they will separate upon their arrival. Rosy has been scarred by the experience and finds herself in total despair.

When I had finished the film, one of the many gripes I had was with the ending - I found the conclusion to be unsatisfying and left me feeling hollow. <b>I then realised that this is exactly how Lean wanted me to feel. This isn't a particularly uplifting or a positively-cathartic story. It intentionally leaves a bittersweet, sour taste in your mouth.</b> The film's resolution contributes towards the greater theme of the story: <b>desire</b>. There are many interpretations of the theme, but I found the film's moral to reminisce of the following quote (which I paraphrased): <b><i>""One must be careful in following their desires; often the thing you are looking for is not somewhere out there, but within""</i></b>. To surmise, this is ultimately a story of a young woman who chases her desires with ecstatic longing, but finds herself in disastrous circumstances as a result.

<i>Ryan's Daughter</i> is a film with compelling ideas regarding the themes of desire and longing; It is brave enough to end on a bittersweet note, rather than an uplifting one. Despite its positives, it is frustrating to think that the film could've been among Lean's greats; <b>had he realised that the film would've worked better as an intimate drama with a sharper runtime, rather than an epic framed against the tensions of the Irish and the British.</b> With it's ups and downs, <b>this is mostly a very solid and ultimately good film</b>.

2020-08-15,Whiplash,2014,https://boxd.it/1iLT0z,5,Yes,"	Growing up, if I failed in something, my mother would comfort me; she would tell me that everything was okay, and that she still loved me. My dad would say and imply the same things, but he would also instruct me on the importance on failure, and how important it was to pick myself back up.

	My dad, to me, was a symbol of strength, endurance and resolution. He was someone that strongly believed in pushing yourself to, or beyond, your limit - whether it be the physical or the mental. Call him old-fashioned, but he really believed that if you wanted to achieve something truly great, you can't be coddled and comforted and be told that everything is okay, and that the second you feel any hint of doubt, you can turn back to your good-old comfort zone (""There are no two words more harmful in the English language, than 'good job'.""). That philosophy is something that I also genuinely support, and it has greatly shaped the man that I am today.

	And that is the personal relevance between myself and the film, Whiplash.

	We find our protagonist, Andrew Neiman, as an innocent young man. There is a great sense of ambition to him; he wants ""to be one of the greats"", but neither him nor the audience know what truly lies ahead of him, should he pursue that treacherous path. His father is a teacher and failed author; a representation of the fear that Andrew holds: Mediocrity. He fears being average, failing to be extraordinary. His desire is to be more than his father: exceptional.

	Andrew's other motivations for his ambition are also illuminated in the dinner scene with his cousins: ""I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was"". He wants to be remembered, to leave a legacy behind. Greatness comes with fame, and that is what drives Andrew to his absolute limit.

	Terrence Fletcher, his musical mentor, sees this potential and drive in Andrew. Fletcher, with the same philosophy as myself and my dad, pushes Andrew to his absolute physical and mental limit through verbal and physical abuse. The result of this is Andrew's descent into near-insanity as he becomes obsessed with his towering ambition; he breaks up with his girlfriend because he believes she will hinder him from his pursuit to greatness, and it is revealed, during the aforementioned dinner scene, that he holds a sense of superiority over others because of his pursuit in this great goal. Furthermore, Andrew's absolute obsession with his ambition is highlighted when his car literally crashes into another truck, and he runs out of the up-turned car to sprint toward the musical competition, covered in his own blood. Fletcher, through his over-the-top methods, has created a machine, a young man who has lost his humanity, innocence and a sense for caring about anyone other than himself.

	This rupturing  tension erupts as Andew realises that he has failed to achieve his goal. His ultimate fear of failing to be extraordinary has caught up to him; in total disbelief, Andrew attacks Fletcher on-stage, resulting in his dismissal from the conservatory.

	Andrew is then lurched out of his obsessed, narrow-minded pursuit, back into real-life. He works a humble job at the restaurant, and he spends more time with his father. His innocence and humanity has returned.

	However, there is a palpable sense that there is something incomplete or off with his life - something seems unsatisfactory. That is the result of having no motivation or drive in his current life.

	In the most thought-provoking scene in the film, Andrew meets up with Fletcher after both of their dismissals from Shaffer conservatory. In their conversation, Fletcher reveals that he was at Shaffer to push his students ""beyond what's expected of them"". He then brings up the story of Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at Charlie Parker; saying that if Jones had been warm and assuring towards Parker, there would have been no Charlie Parker. Andrew answers back, asking where one has to draw the line. Fletcher retaliates, saying that the next Charlie Parker wouldn't never get discouraged; he then reflects at the fact that he never had a Charlie Parker. Andrew looks at Fletcher after the line is delivered, and you can almost see the gleam in Andrew's eyes: a spark has been set aflame as he returns to his drums.

	What then follows is the iconic final scene at the music festival: Fletcher reveals that this was a ploy to get revenge against Andrew as the band plays a song that he doesn't know. Andrew is shamed on-stage, Fletcher getting his malicious satisfaction as Andrew runs off-stage to his father's arms. At that moment, Andrew decides to turn back to the stage in redemption, as his father looks on in horror. There are many interpretations as to what drove Andrew to get back on-stage. I believe. in that moment, Andrew recalled the story of Jones and Parker, and that is what pushed him to get back on-stage; the realisation that if he wouldn't get discouraged by this moment, then he could truly be one of the greats. Andrew then plays a phenomenal solo in an incredible finale, echoing the solo of Parker after having a cymbal thrown at him the year prior.

	The scene is breathtaking, impeccably well-edited and masterfully-directed, but there is a slight ambiguity that pervades the final solo: Andrew has fully returned to his pursuit. No one knows what happens next, but one can be certain that at the very least he will have lost his innocence and humanity, possibly he will have lost them for good; there is also the possibility of a young suicide that awaits him. This is why his father had a look of horror as he saw his son go back on-stage, seeing him descend back into his obsessed pursuit of greatness. As an audience, we are wowed by Andrew's talent, but also horrified at what awaits him.

	The reason I love Whiplash is because it poses intellectually-stimulating arguments - Fletcher had a very fair and reasonable point: Charlie Parker would have never been the great he was if Jones had told him ""good job"". His intention is completely understandable, but one has to recall Andrew's retaliation: Where do you draw the line? Fletcher's methods resulted in the suicide of a 30-year-old, his former student Sean Casey, and the creation of a soulless machine in Andrew, a machine that could possible commit suicide like Sean Casey. Even now as I write this review, I don't know where to stand. Fletcher has a very good point, but do what extent to you carry that philosophy?

	To bring it full-circle - back to my dad. I agree and believe in my dad's philosophy: If one wants to achieve true greatness, you should be pushed to your absolute limit, and sometimes the person you love the most has to look you in the eye and say something discouraging - something other than ""good job""; something that will give you the drive to push yourself beyond your boundaries. What I found most peculiar is that Fletcher and my dad both believe in the exact same thing, but if there's something I've learned from film, it's that it's not about your intention - it's about your method. If my dad was a conductor at Shaffer, I'm sure he would've gone about it much more differently to Fletcher, despite the fact that they both have the same philosophy.

	Other than the layered and thought-provoking script, the film is, as I have already mentioned, impeccably well-edited by the tremendously-talented Tom Cross. Whiplash was the first film that made me aware of the editing, making me discover another layer to the invisible craft of filmmaking.

	J.K. Simmons also delivers an indelible performance as Fletcher. He lives and breathes in the soul of a border-line sociopath. He exudes shivering terror when he needs to, and is the highlight of every scene that he's in. An absolutely terrifying, yet terrific performance.

	Whiplash is a film posing thought-provoking ideas that I still grapple with today. Furthermore, the direction, sound, cinematography, performances and editing are absolutely phenomenal. The result is a near-masterpiece. Bravo Damien Chazelle.",,2020-08-14
2020-08-18,Brief Encounter,1945,https://boxd.it/1j7F2P,5,,"This is not a film that makes you leave the cinema with a spring in your step, or with a more hopeful view on life. Brief Encounter is a film about despair, guilt, and a desperate longing to liberate yourself from an endless cage. The film begins and ends with an inevitably doomed romance - a romance that is is shrouded in guilt; a romance that is fueled by an intangible desire to pursue, but is shackled by the shame of your actions. A romance that is destined to fail, never to last.

Despite that, Brief Encounter has to be one of the most emotionally-poignant pieces of art that I have ever experienced.

The film begins at the end - a doctor bidding a brief and emotionally-hollow farewell to a woman he'll never see again. There seems to be a palpable sense of despair between the couple as they depart unceremoniously; as an audience, we don't know how or why these emotions came to fruition. Our questions are then answered by the following scenes, supplemented by the protagonist's (Laura) narration.

I must admit, I wasn't a fan of the narration style at first. As Laura shamefully narrates her cherished, yet guilt-ridden moments with the doctor, it struck me that the narration wasn't intended for the audience. The narration itself is a confession - but the worst part, is that the confession is intended for her husband, however Laura cannot ever tell him of her secret relationship with the doctor. This self-contained confession accentuates the film's themes of repression, thus the narration serves a very definitive purpose.

Repressed guilt and self-eroding despair. That is the unfortunate reality for Laura and Alec; those are the two emotions that shackle their relationship from truly blooming; their romance engulfed in guilt and shame - from beginning to end. I found this to be such a striking contrast: their unmeasured love for each other, framed against their shackling guilt of loving each other.

And that is why the film's beginning is so impactful - we know the ending of the story: an unceremonious and despairing farewell. The result of structuring the story like this, is that there is a great sense of pain and despair pervading the relationship from the beginning of the film right to end; constructing a heart-wrenching experience that the audience must endure and experience.

I should also mention the effectiveness of (one of) the film's settings: a train station. It is a place where trains come and go; a great sense of futility and a lack of purpose in a seemingly endless cycle. As Laura pondered in an early monologue: ""There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore, when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully how silly I was. No, no, I don't want that time to come ever. I want to remember every minute, always, always to the end of my days"". Life is big, towering and imposing. Alec, the doctor, is an idealist with great ambitions; I myself strive to live a big and satisfying life, but what I learned from the film is to appreciate the small and fleeting moments in our lives - the brief encounters. Life is short - no feelings last a long while; appreciate the flickering moments that are happening in front of your eyes right now.

That is what Brief Encounter is to me: a film that aches and oozes with unadulterated beauty. It's a film about repressed guilt and shame in the face of an ultimately doomed romance, the shackling feeling of bottling up your emotions, feeling trapped and unhappy for a reason you cannot understand. The film is abundant in striking contrast: Love and Shame, Hope and Futility. Brief Encounter is truly a tremendous piece of art, one that I have been so glad to have experienced.",,2020-08-17
2020-09-17,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,https://boxd.it/1mfE23,4.5,Yes,"	The Original Trilogy gave us one of the most indelible trios in cinematic history: Luke, Han and Leia. They became icons - legends. As an audience, we admired them, rooted for them, and got inspired by them.

	And this is why I love the direction that the sequel trilogy was taking: Rey and Finn began their stories as nobodies, and they got entangled with one of the most revered hero in the galaxy - Han Solo. The pair are in awe; they heard this Rebellion leader triumph in hundreds of stories; he was an inspiration to them. While Finn and Rey were underwhelmed at Han Solo at first, he underwent an internal change, one which resulted in him returning to help the Resistance. Our expectations of him were subverted at first, but were re-aligned when he came back to being the Han Solo that we remembered.

	However - In The Last Jedi, Rey's perception of another legend would be confronted. The illustrious and iconic Jedi Master: Luke Skywalker. But her perception of Luke wouldn't just be confronted like it was with Han. With Luke, her image of him would be shattered.

	The character of Luke Skywalker was a very controversial talking point of The Last Jedi. Personally, I really liked the path Rian Johnson took with the character - I thought the move was bold, subversive (more on that later) and ambitious.

	In his exile, Luke has been drowned in guilt and trauma at his failures - most notably, his creation of Kylo Ren. Luke believed himself to be responsible for turning his nephew - his best friend and sister's son - to the dark side (""It was me... I failed""). He has lost total faith in the Jedi (""It's time for the Jedi to end""), and has closed himself off from the force. For about 20 years these feelings have seeped into Luke, killing his soul. What brings Luke out of his despairing and spiteful state is not the budding Rey, or the memory of his past friends, or the impeding threat of the First Order. It's his conversation with Yoda. From it, he ultimately learns that ""The greatest teacher, failure is"" - The legacy of the Jedi is not success and triumph, but failure. With this, Luke truly confronts his past, accepting the real event as it happened, rather than alienating his memory as a coping mechanism for his trauma. The result of this self-acceptance propels him to give his much-needed assistance to the Resistance. However, his assistance doesn't come in the form of 'walking through a blaze of glory with a laser sword' - Johnson doesn't give the audience what they want, but what they need (I think the entirety of The Last Jedi could be described with that one sentence). He doesn't fight - but rather confronts Kylo Ren; doing so in the most Jedi way possible: Pacifism. But what's most interesting about their final 'duel' is not the duel itself, but what happens prior; Luke tells Leia: ""I can't save him... No one's ever really gone"". Through this scene, it is illuminated that Luke has learned from Yoda's lesson; he has accepted that the act of turning Kylo from the dark to the light is not to be done by him, but by the next generation: ""Pass on what you have learned... We are what they grow beyond"". I will expand more on this later when I discuss the themes of the film, but I will note that Luke's journey is the figurative passing of the baton from one generation to the next.

	With all the stars aligned, Luke's arc is one step away from being satisfyingly completed (a hot, controversial, yet subjective opinion): Sitting before the sight of the binary sunset sunrise. It's apparent that he's reflecting on his life - the unforgettable adventures and the despairing heartbreak. His eyes don't hold the look of wide-eyed innocence and desire like they did in his youth, rather the look of wisdom and satisfaction. One who solidified his legacy as a true Jedi. One who can be considered a true Legend.

	Rey's character flaw in The Force Awakens was that she was burdened by her parents: She was convinced that they would return (""They'll be back""), and she was thusly held back by that belief (""But I have to get home""). While she did overcome that hurdle in The Force Awakens, she was still burdened by the identity of her parents; and this was fully confronted in The Last Jedi. Luke questions her: ""What's special about you?"", and one can get the sense that within her, Rey desperately wants to learn that her parents were important - and that her incredible potential (""I've only seen this raw strength once before"") brewing inside her would come from her legacy. What Rey then needs to learn, is that she can carve her own path, and her destiny is irrelevant of her parentage. I (Oh look over there, an opinion) loved Johnson's reveal of Rey's parentage: her parents are nobodies, primarily because it proved that excellence can come from anywhere - you don't need Skywalker blood to be gifted with the force (You should've seen my reaction to Rey's Palpatine reveal in The Rise Of Skywalker :/).

	While Rey's character was handled to a (Hey! An opinion!) strong degree, it wouldn't have been as effective without her thoroughly dynamic relationship with Kylo Ren.

	In The Last Jedi's beginning, Kylo is engulfed in shame, guilt and self-loathing. He is, as Rey puts it (rather bluntly, I will admit): ""conflicted"". He so desperately wants to be the ultimate symbol of darkness and evil, but he finds himself to be utterly conflicted, torn between the goodness of his parents and the evil of Snoke and Darth Vader. In Kylo's eyes, his lineage and legacy is a curse that plagues him. This, and Snoke's emotional manipulation, propels him to smash his helmet; a figurative severing of his relationship with his icon and grandfather: Darth Vader. This act cements his decision to hold his own identity: to be Kylo Ren, rather than the grandson of Darth Vader. What I found most interesting, is that the decision Kylo makes at the beginning of the film, is the decision Rey needs, but ultimately makes, at the end of the film. The symmetry is admittedly beautiful, but the beauty lies in their dynamic yet conflicting relationship: Kylo believes that she must ""Let the past die""; to purge her lineage as it holds her back. Rey is challenged by this philosophy, and through Ridley's performance, we can see the fleeting moment of temptation in her eyes as Kylo offers his hand. However (and what I like about the following part is that Johnson conveys his characters internal thoughts through their actions, rather than monologue), Rey denies his hand - and thusly his ideology. Rey does not believe in letting her past die, she accepts the harsh truth - the truth she needed to hear - that her parents were nobodies, and this will not define her. We then find out in a later scene that the revelation of her parentage was the limit to her potential: with this truth realised, she was able to use the force to lift a mound of boulders. Her inner potential has been truly uncaged. (Note how Johnson, once again, uses actions to reveal internal truths/thoughts in this particular scene)

	A common criticism of The Last Jedi is the Canto Bight sequence; and I do believe that criticism to have merit: it's quite jarring in contrast to the other events of the film, and negatively impacts the pacing as a result. For these reasons, the sequence should have been thoroughly revised, but it cannot be denied that despite it's problems, it does in fact serve an important role for our next character: Finn. Many aspects directly related to the character of Finn were executed (I freely admit this) with rough edges: Canto Bight, Rose, and his relationship with the plot. Despite those rough edges, there is a good arc to be found in his character.

	In The Force Awakens, Finn's actions in that film's final acts were for Rey, not for the Resistance, so it was evident that this aspect would be explored in The Last Jedi - and it was. In The Last Jedi's first act, Finn is (rather subtly I will admit, I think Johnson should have been more explicit in this scenario) implied to be neither with the Resistance nor the First Order. This sets up compelling conflict for the character: he must find his stance. It does get a little rocky from here - Finn, who is conflicted with which side he wants to stand with, decides to go on a dangerous mission - but this time it's not to help Rey, rather to help the Resistance. It's a contradictory action, but one could take the interpretation that, in that moment, Finn made the impulsive decision to help the Resistance, but he wasn't fully sure if the Resistance was the right side for him. It's a bit of a stretch I'll freely admit, and not fully plausible. Finn then arrives at Canto Bight - yes, it has problems relating to the narrative, but as I've written earlier, it does serve a purpose for the character of Finn. He meets DJ, the character which provides Finn with the evidence that the war is not as black-and-white as he thinks it is: ""It's all machine, partner"". Eerily similar to how Rey was tempted by Kylo's request, Finn is also tempted (Shown through Boyega's performance) to follow DJ's nomadic path: ""Live Free - don't join""; however, Finn is also compelled by Rose, who's function is to align Finn with his moral responsibility: to stand with the Resistance. In a brilliantly-executed scene, Finn combats Phasma. Although it's important to note that the fight's excellence doesn't come from the theatricality or spectacle, but by the ideological battle - Finn is battling the embodiment of everything he hated about the First Order; it's his internal battle brought to life: Good vs. Evil, The Resistance vs. The First Order. In the end, Finn chooses to reside with the Resistance - but this time it's not subtle or implicit like his introduction. He clearly states: ""Rebel scum"". Although, his arc doesn't end there: On the salt-planet Crait, Finn prepares to sacrifice himself - turning off all comms and closing his eyes as his life ends with a morally-good act - proving that he not only stands with the Resistance, but is willing to give his life to something he genuinely believes in. He is unexpectedly stopped by Rose; I will say that this particular encounter was handled quite clunkily, her line - and the kiss seems... off. And it's a shame that an awkwardly-executed moment like that has to follow right after an expertly-handled moment where Finn made the decision to give his life for The Resistance.

	And that concludes my character analysis of The Last Jedi. If I were to surmise it, I would say that on paper, the depth and complexity is simply astounding. There are some flaws in its transition from script to screen; most notably, I thought that some character details and motivations could have been a degree more explicit, because it can be difficult to fully discern the characters without doing a deep-dive like I'm doing right now. Moreover, in the case of Finn, his character's arc did have a negative impact on the film's pacing due to its narrative obligation.

	I wrote above how I would expand upon the subversion of the film. Well I'm going to explain that here and now: I really loved the subversive nature of the film. Now, I would like to clear up (and this backs up the point that art is truly subjective) that I really like when films are daring - I admire filmmakers who have the incredible ambition to challenge ideas or notions. My favourite two films of all time display this: The Dark Knight and La La Land; films that deeply challenge their respective genres - and do so successfully in my opinion. So... maybe I do have a personal bias towards subversion in filmmaking.  Although I will still argue why I believe, rationally rather than emotionally, that the subversive aspects of The Last Jedi are a success rather than a failure - it's important to note that the subversive aspect of the film clearly worked for me, but clearly didn't work for others, proving my previous point that art is subjective. Nonetheless, this is my take:

	When a film subverts the audiences expectations, it generates surprise. However, it is important to note that when a film subverts for the sake of garnering an audience reaction, then it is a gimmick. Simple as. But The Last Jedi doesn't just subvert its audience's expectations solely to get an emotional or a surprise reaction. While surprise is an inherent part of the subversion, it is not the only reason behind it. The motivation behind the film's subversive nature stems from one root: Rian Johnson wishes to challenge and confront the ideas and notions of the previous Star Wars films. Many rush to call The Last Jedi a film that disrespects its predecessors - and I wholly disagree. This film is the amalgation of one fan's love and passion for these films. If you deeply love your father, do you accept and acknowledge everything he says without question? No. The exact same is the case with The Last Jedi and the Star Wars saga; Johnson didn't 'disrespect' the previous films by challenging them - in fact, that's the greatest sign of respect and admiration that one can hold for someone else. Johnson acknowledges the competence and depth of the previous films - that's why he chose to not only take on The Last Jedi in the first place, but also why he decided to revisit those notions - because they were worth revisiting.

	This is why the subversive nature of the film worked so well for me: The film features many moments of subversion simply because the film itself is subversive - we were taken aback by Johnson's decision to challenge the earlier films' ideas and notions, and thusly, the subversive nature of the film is extremely fitting, and I found it to be a definitive success.

	But what specifically did Johnson's film challenge? It challenged the idea and mythos of heroes and legends. This is why I opened this analysis by discussing how Luke, Han and Leia were solidified as icons and heroes. They served as inspirations for us, and were completely revered. We saw them as heroes, phenomenal individuals who've reached heights that were out of our own. We held an exceptionally-high standard for them to follow, and when they didn't surpass it, we reacted with betrayal - it's a natural reaction because these people mean so much to us.

	This was the aspect in the Original Trilogy that Johnson felt needed exploring. Luke, one of the most revered heroes in the galaxy, started out just like us: in desperate search of adventure - an escape from the banal. He got what he wanted: an unforgettable adventure that we were swept along with. From his trials and tribulations, he became Luke Skywalker, and as a result, he became our icon and inspiration. Luke Skywalker, and all of our other heroes: Han and Leia, were surrounded by a legendary mythos - a transcended being of unlimited potential and perfection. That right there, was the aspect that Johnson wanted to explore: we have forgotten that these heroes were once like us, and that they are still human - they still make mistakes and commit failure. And that's the core reason why I love Johnson's approach to Luke - he stripped him of his mythos: behind that heroic facade that we made for him, there was an imperfect individual.

	This challenging notion - that our heroes are not the perfect embodiments that we make them out to be, in conjunction with Kylo's ""Let the past die"" philosophy can seem quite hopeless and heartbreaking: to suggest that our heroes should be cast out and forgotten. But that's the exact opposite of what Johnson conveyed in his story. The Last Jedi, at its ultimate core, is a story about the inspiration of our heroes to the next generation. This is why Johnson chose to end his film with a group of (intentionally) unnamed and unknown children, who are enraptured and dazzled by the legendary tale of Luke Skywalker. Moreover, through Luke Skywalker's arc, Johnson conveyed the theme of 'passing on' - for our heroes to pass the baton on to our generation, as they leave us not just with what they have learned, but with inspiration and empowerment. Therefore, Johnson's challenges of the previous films' ideas shouldn't have been perceived as cold-hearted criticism. Rather, he actually built upon the prior films' themes of heroes and legends, and the result is that the thematic complexity of the Star Wars saga has been greatly deepened.

	The Last Jedi is the most inconsistent Star Wars film for me - there are some clunky and awkward moments; I also felt that the Finn and Rose subplot should have been revised. But! This film reaches astronomical heights that no other Star Wars film has reached for me before: I found the writing of Kylo and Rey to be impeccable - and the whole throne room scene has to be one of the best-executed moments ever in Star Wars, as well as that, the Holdo Maneuver was simply breathtaking. The visual language in this film was also incredible - I'm not just talking about Yedlin's luscious cinematography, but the surging motivation behind the camera. Moreover, I loved the ideas featured in the film: While our heroes can be flawed at times, they ultimately serve an incredible inspiration for us; also encompassing the idea of passing on from one generation, to the next - the baton is in our hands now, and our heroes are behind us. I also loved the fact that this film was actually made: it's incredibly ambitious, and the love, passion and personality just oozes out of this film, and it's clearly evident from the first frame that this film was handled with hands that held incredible endearment for Star Wars. It's the kind of film that audiences need: films that have the bravery to be audacious, bold and enlightening - rather than to rely on what has worked in the past. The Last Jedi is so starkly beautiful, and in my eyes, it is not only one of my favourite Star Wars films, but is the most unique one that I have had the absolute pleasure of experiencing.",,2020-09-16
